Inspired by SkyLine wallpaper released on Android's Play Store.

Then the project got hooked up with the energy of GLSL to source those cool and lovely effects over at [glslsandbox.com](http://glslsandbox.com). With over 45k+ available and it keeps increasing, imagine you would have amazing GLSL effect showing up on your Android phone every now and then.
